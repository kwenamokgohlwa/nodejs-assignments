1. A node module is an example of the separation of concerns where each module contains code pertaining to a specific area or topic. It encapsulates functionality and allows for modular programming.

2. Exports is a reference to module.exports and allows you to assign things to it without overwriting the module.exports variable. module.exports is a empty object that can be imported in any other js file.

3. This is because it is not as strict as module.exports and using it will not overwrite module.exports and results in writing less code.
